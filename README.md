# Football Data Scraping & Analysis

This repository contains my practice notebooks for learning **web scraping** and **data science basics** with Python.

## 📌 What I Learned
- Fetching CSV data directly from the web with `pandas.read_csv()`
- Using **Pandas** for:
  - Filtering DataFrames (one/multiple conditions)
  - Creating conditional columns with `where()` and `np.select()`
  - Using `isin()` for filtering
  - Finding and removing duplicates
- Using **NumPy** together with Pandas for data processing
- Basic **data cleaning** and exploration

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy

## 🚀 Next Steps
- More advanced web scraping with BeautifulSoup / requests
- Data visualization (Matplotlib / Seaborn)
- Building small machine learning models
